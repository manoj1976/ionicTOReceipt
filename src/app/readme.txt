    sudo ionic cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-console   --- donâ€™t want the debug console plugin enabled, so we should remove it before generating the release builds:
    sudo ionic cordova build --release android   --- generate a release build for Android -- this will generate the apk file.

Generate the key using the following command
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore melvinsoftware-release-key.keystore -alias msw_releasekey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
Password: ionicapp2017


To sign the unsigned APK, run the jarsigner tool which is also included in the JDK:

    sudo jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore melvinsoftware-release-key.keystore platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-release-unsigned.apk msw_releasekey

Finally, we need to run the zip align tool to optimize the APK. The zipalign tool can be found in <android sdk>/build-tools
-- copy the zipalign exe to the project folder
    zipalign -v 4 HelloWorld-release-unsigned.apk HelloWorld.apk -- just an e.g. -- didn't work
    ./zipalign -v 4 platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-release-unsigned.apk TransferOrderRcpt.apk
    the above command worked



    open Google Play Store Developer Console  https://play.google.com/apps/publish/?dev_acc=17073949706322634170
    an upload the app.
